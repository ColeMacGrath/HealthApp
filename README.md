## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15 or later
- An iPhone or iPad running iOS 17 or later

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to

   ```

    and insert your OpenAI key as follows:

   - Key: `openAIKey`
   - Value: `YourKeyValueHere`

### Installation

## Mocking With Proxyman ![In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/coming-soon)

To test HealthApp with simulated data:

1. Install Proxyman on your Mac.

2. Configure Proxyman to route HealthApp's network traffic through it.

   1. Project is working with following loca URL: https://api.healthapp.local/

   2. For configuring URL's, paths, etc. confifgure at: HealthApp/Models/Shared/RequestManager.swift

      1. You'll find base url like this: 

      ```swift
      private init() {
        self.baseURL = "https://api.healthApp.local/"
      }
      ```

      2. For enpoints you'll fund an enum like this:

      ```swift
      enum EndPoint: String {
          case login = "login"
          case doctors = "doctors"
          case bookApointment = "bookAppointment"
          case appointments = "appointments"
          case patients = "patients"
      }
      ```

3. Configure your paths:

Since all scripts works with JSON files you'll need to configure your project's paths, by default in all scripts you'll find something like this at the begging of file: 

```javascript
const userFilePath = "~/Documents/Developer/iOS/";
```

You'll need to replace this for the path where your project is located.

|    Script Name     |                   Matching Rule                   |   Type   | Method |
| :----------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: | :------: | :----: |
|  Book Appointment  |    https://api.healthapp.local/bookAppointment    | Wildcard |  POST  |
| Delete Appointment | https:\/\/api\.healthApp\.local\/.*\/appointment  |  Regex   | DELETE |
|  Appointment List  |        https://api.healthapp.local/doctors        | Wildcard |  GET   |
|     Add Doctor     | https:\/\/api\.healthapp\.local\/.*\/appointments |  Regex   | PATCH  |
|   Delete Doctor    |        https://api.healthapp.local/doctors        | Wildcard | DELETE |
|    Doctors List    |   https:\/\/api\.healthapp\.local\/.*\/doctors    |  Regex   |  GET   |
|   Patients List    |   https:\/\/api\.healthapp\.local\/.*\/patients   |  Regex   |  GET   |
